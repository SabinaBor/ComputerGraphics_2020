The changes that we made can be found under mainview.cpp, mainview.h and vertshader.glsl. 
The difficulties that we encountered are mostly with the colouring of the cube and pyramid (setting all of it clockwise/counter clockwise properly).
We used the functions setScale, setRotation, initializeGL, paintGL and a new function setModels for modifying the project.
