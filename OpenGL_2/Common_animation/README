It has been decided to use the code from the last assignment OpenGL due to the wrong position of the MainWindow in OpenGL3. Therefore:

Files modified: mainview.cpp, mainview.h, fragshader_phong.glsl, vertshader_phong.glsl

Files added: mercurymap.jpg, earthmap.png, grid.obj, jupitermap.jpg

To minimize code duplication, we have decided to use arrays.
In our program we created 4 different objects, which are 3 spheres of different size and 1 cat. It demonstrates three planets and alien cat. Transformations applied: translation and rotation. Earth and mercury rotate aroung themselves, jupiter and cat rotate around the Earth. 

The Water sub-assignment has not been implemented
